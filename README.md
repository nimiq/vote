Run a development server that watches the project files,
compiles them on demand and hot-reloads the changes to keep your browser in sync:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Lint your code and automatically fix lint errors:

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

Compile and minify the project to be ready for deployment in production:
